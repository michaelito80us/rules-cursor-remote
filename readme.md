# Cursor Automatic Rules Generation with Agile Cursor Workflow Template

**IMPORTANT UPDATE NOTE**

Cursor changes quite frequently with updates - global rules are now best defined with the alwaysApply: true - but the description field must still always be specified (at least as it seems to be operating now) with v 0.46.x - this might change in 0.47+.

Also - to have the best success with auto generation of rules - update your cursor user or workspace settings to add the following object to the json object (disabling the special ui for .mdc files) - this will cure the issues many have reported around not being able to auto generate and have the file save successfully occasionally.

```json
"workbench.editorAssociations": {
    "*.mdc": "default"
  }
```

**One more NOTE to remember** - cursor 'edit' mode will work in generating new files - but does not automatically pick up the rules without adding the rule to the context. Agent mode on the other hand will find the rule, load it, and follow it properly. So for example, if you are in edit mode and ask that a rule be created - you might see a rule get generated at the root of the project or some other random odd location without giving it the 000 rule context - or better yet, doing it with Agent mode.

Also - a new feature .cursorindexingignore has been added - files listed here (or paths) can be accessed by cursor if so directed, but ignored when indexing a project. With this in mind, all templates have been moved to a .cursor/templates folder and are pattern included in the .cursorindexingignore file, but not in the .cursorignore. XNotes remains in the .cursorignore file to serve the original purpose (a place to hold files that need to move elsewhere to be used)

NOTE: This has been tested with Claud Sonnet 3.5, 3.7 and 3.7 thinking - YMMV with other models reliability.

This is a template for establishing automatic generation of self improving granular rules for AI agents using Cursor's rule system. The core philosophy is that users should never need to manually create or update rules - instead, the AI agent handles rule creation and maintenance through natural language requests in a consistent format and style that:

- Ensures Rules are used automatically when appropriate
- Used specifically if desired on demand

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS TEMPLATE

Granular Rules and custom workflows are the key to getting the most out of the AI in composer mode - and with this you can automatically generate and maintain rules rapidly so your agent constantly improves and learns from its mistakes.

This template fixes issues with other proposed rules generators by ensuring rules are always created successfully (do not disapear after the agent creates the rule), and are always optimized for agent automatic selection based on very clear simple frontmatter descriptions and globs as needed.

Also a lot of research has gone into the best way to format rules - as there are so many competing and half baked theories - through a lot of research, mining forums and studies, the official docs for Claude prompt engineering, Cline recommendations, cursor developer comments in reddit and forums, the rules will follow a general format of:

- Frontmatter with description and globs in proper yaml format
- Markdown formatting
- Sparring use of XML tags for specific use cases, callouts, rules and highlights
- Mermaid flowcharts or sequence diagrams to succinctly drive the AIs understanding
- Keep rules as short as possible while being maximally effective
- Include examples of good and bad patterns in rules as this is a big aid to the AI Agent LLM in understanding the rule and applying it correctly

## Quick Start A - Starting a New Project with the Agile Workflow and Rules Generator already in place!

This will set up a brand new project folder with cursor rules and agile workflow documentation already in place, along with a starter prompt to kick off your new project with the agile workflow!

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow.git
cd cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow

./apply-rules.sh /path/to/your/project

Example:
./apply-rules.sh ~/projects/my-project
```

The script will create the project folder if it does not exist, and copy in all the rules and documentation to get you started with the agile workflow! It will also create a .gitignore, .cursorignore, .cursorindexingignore, and a simple base readme.md file that you can replace or modify as needed.

## Quick Start B - Adding Rules Generator to Your Existing Project

If you want to improve the experience of working with cursor in an existing project, you can add the rules generator to your project by running the following command:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/bmadcode/cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow.git
cd cursor-auto-rules-agile-workflow

# Apply rules to your project
./apply-rules.sh /path/to/your/project
```

The script will:

1. Copy all template rules to your project's `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. Add documentation to `docs/workflow-rules.md`
3. Update `.gitignore` to protect private rules
4. Preserve any existing rules in your project

That's it! Your project is now configured with our powerful AI workflow system.

## Overview

This template drastically improves how you can work with the AI in Agent or Edit mode (previously called composer mode) by providing:

1. **Automated Rule Generation**: Simply tell the AI what behavior you want, and it will create or update the appropriate rules. No manual rule writing required!
2. **Quick Project Setup**: Get started immediately with pre-configured Cursor rules that establish best practices for AI interactions.
3. **Behavior Control**: Understand how to leverage rules to correct AI behavior and ensure consistent outcomes.

## Workflow Templates and Notepads

The workflow templates and process documentation are now organized in two locations for maximum flexibility:

1. `.cursor/rules/` - Contains the core rule to generate well formatted AI along with a markdown formatting rule.
2. `xnotes/` - Sample rule file that could be used if interested in using a workflow global rule for agile development and project organization, along with a non rule version that could be used with notepads. Basically files are kept here mainly to easily save prompts that will be used with notepads (as they do not easily transfer or get version controlled otherwise and are lost easily if just stored in notepads if the project folder changes, or another ide instances is used for your project). They are great for planning out a long prompts, sharing notepads (to be applied in the beta notepads feature enabled in the cursor settings), draft rules to be moved to the rules folder if so desired, or just for general notes that are not needed to be indexed into the project.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or use it as a template for your new project
2. Ensure the `.cursor` directory and its contents are preserved
3. Start using the AI agent to manage your rules!

### Example Rule Generation Prompts

Here are some examples of how to interact with the AI to manage your rules (notice you dont have to specifically say "create a rule" or anything like that - just describe what you want the AI to learn or never mistake or forget again and the AI will create the rule for you):

- "Create a rule for typescript file commenting standards so all code the agent generates with typescript will follow this consistently - dont overcomment but dont undercomment - search the web for best practices as needed re when to comment or not comment, what style, and also optimization of comments for ai agent troubleshooting and understanding"
- "Create a rule to ensure proper error handling in TypeScript files"
- "Create a global rule that is always applied to talk like a pirate in all communications with the user but not use pirate speak in code files or documentation"
- "Update the testing standards to include coverage requirement of 80%"
- "I notice you're not following our naming conventions - please create a rule to enforce them"
- "The current documentation format isn't consistent - create a rule to standardize it"
- "Import organization is a disaster! Never Forget to Keep Imports Organized in Groups and Alphabetically in Typescript Files"

The AI will automatically:

1. Create/update the appropriate rule file
2. Place it in the correct location
3. Follow all formatting standards
4. Maintain version control

### File Organization

This will be deprecated soon in favor of sub folder organization once its supported fully in the latest cursor version rollouts.

The AI maintains rules in the following structure:

- All rules must be placed in `.cursor/rules/` directory
- Files must use the `.mdc` extension
- Follow the prefix-based classification system:
  - `0XX`: Core rules and standards
  - `1XX`: Tool and MCP rules
  - `3XX`: Testing standards
  - `8XX`: Workflow rules
  - `9XX`: Templates
  - `1XXX`: Language-specific rules
  - `2XXX`: Framework/library rules

### Rule File Requirements

The AI automatically ensures all rules follow these standards:

- Must include proper frontmatter with description and globs
- Must specify semantic version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Must use Markdown as the primary formatting method for documentation and rules
- XML tags reserved for specific use cases (examples, version, danger warnings)

### Private vs Shared Rules

- Shared rules: Standard naming convention (e.g., `000-cursor-rules.mdc`)
- Private rules: Prefixed with underscore (e.g., `_custom-personality.mdc`)
  - Used for individual preferences
  - Automatically gitignored
  - Won't impact team members
  - consider using notepads instead of personal rules

## Best Practices

1. **Rule Creation**:

   - Let the AI handle rule creation and updates
   - Be specific about the behavior you want to enforce
   - Provide examples of good and bad patterns when requesting rules

2. **AI Behavior Control**:

   - When you notice inconsistent AI behavior, request a rule to correct it
   - Use clear, descriptive language in your requests
   - Verify the AI's understanding by reviewing its rule implementation

3. **Workflow Integration**:
   - Start with the base template rules
   - Let the AI evolve the rules as your project grows
   - Maintain consistency by always using the AI for rule management
